<!--
Section 1: Statemet of the projet topic and the primary question.
-->
# Project Description

What is our question?
Who does it apply to
What type data can answer this question
What can we predict
How can this be used

<!--
Section 2: Data Description
Be sure to give enough of a reference where a reader/student in this class can access the data and reproduce your analysis.
-->
# Data Description

What data are we working with
Who owns/made the data
Where can you find the data
How does this data help answer our question
Is there flaws in the data 
Put in a references to the site, data location, etc.
We might want to reference the github location here as well.

<!-- 
Statistical and graphical methods used
-->

# Statistical Analysis

How is our spatial model setup
Explain our methodology 
Why predict a spatial poisson process
Explain the algorithm.

<!--
Results and conclusion. 
Make sure you give succinct conclusion that addresses your question. If you are doing a spatial analysis, make it useful to include the estimesr of regression parameters and the variance and range parameters in your results.
